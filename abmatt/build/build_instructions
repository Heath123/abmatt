Building the distribution is done through build.py.
It uses the 'pyinstaller' package to build the binaries. It creates a single file '__main__' in the 'dist' folder.
In order to build sucessfully, all required modules must be found. (Hopefully in venv/Lib/site-packages)
The installer for distributions is also created, but may require additional dependencies:

For Windows you need the following on your system path:
1. make (for using makefile)
2. makensis (windows installer)
    a. Additionally the EnVar plug-in is required.
3. 7z (zipping installer)
